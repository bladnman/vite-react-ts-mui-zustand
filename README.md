# My Cool App

This is a cool app that does cool things. I am a cool developer.
It will always be cool. Cool cool cool.


# How to use this template

### Clone this repo and enter the directory.

```bash
# change my-cool-app to the name of your new app
git clone https://github.com/bladnman/vite-react-ts-mui-zustand.git my-cool-app
cd my-cool-app
```

### Run initial_install command
This will change the name in the package.json. It will also
install all the dependencies for the app. It will also create
a new git repo for your app and make the first commit.

```bash
# Run the initial_install script
yarn initial_install
```


# Update your cool app

Once you clone this repo, you can update the app to make it even cooler.
We advise that you rename a few things. Here are simple steps:

- `/index.html` - Change the title of the app.
- `/index.html` - Find a new favicon for your app.
- `/src/index.css` - Change the default colors for text and background.
- `/src/pages/main-page/MainPage.tsx` - Get rid of the default content.
- `README.md` - Replace the content with your own.

# Run your cool app

```bash
# Run the app in development mode
yarn start
```

# Build your cool app
After building your app you will have a `dist` folder that 
you can deploy to a server.

```bash
# Build the app for production
yarn build
```
